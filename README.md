# Escapism
GIMM VR Project

360 Sounds:
    Unity 1:
- Added sound for an ambient buzz sound for the prison that is looping
- Added alarm sound which is triggered by the player running into trigger zone 
- Added ambient rain sound that exists for the entire scene

    Unity 2: 
- Added one reverb zone to the initial prison cell that the player spawns in and set it to padded cell
    - Did this to create claustrophobic effect
Added large reverb zone to the intial prison area 
    - Did this to convey the scale of the building and to create a realistic prison feeling like how I imagine an empty prison would feel
